# Deep Dive into Deep Learning for Multi-Label Classification

This repository contains resources for the assignment on deep learning approaches to multi-label classification (MLC). It includes the following:

## Overview
Multi-label classification (MLC) is a critical area in supervised learning where instances are associated with multiple labels. This repository focuses on the advancements in deep learning techniques addressing challenges like label dependency, high-dimensional labels, data sparsity, and imbalanced datasets.
